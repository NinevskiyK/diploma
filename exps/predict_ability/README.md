# Predict ability

X_server - real stand run with X servers up

X_server_sim - simulation

see index.html or build it yourself by Gatling (`gatling.sh -ro PATH_TO_SIMULATION.LOG`)

Experiment:
- Run stand runs for 10 minutes
- Adjust parameters of request time so simulation for 1 server is close
- See how simulation predicts 2 servers
